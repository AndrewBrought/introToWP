Installing and running WordPress; Installing and running WordPress Shared Hosting

FLYWHEEL - is a hosting company
LOCAL - is a tool offered by FLYWHEEL to make developing sites locally and deploying them to FLYWHEEL hosting easy.

WordPress needs an environment with three main components:
    - database (MySQL)
    - web hosting env (Apache or NGINX)
    - Application language - php support

When you create a new site under LOCAL, you create a new container, a virtual computer with it's own MySQL, Apache or
NGINX, and php setup.

That means each site is fully separate and can have it's own custom hosting configurations.

FLYWHEEL handles the process of setting up and maintaining these containers is done automatically by the app.
    - You just set how you want your env configured and site to function

local.getflywheel.com (https://localwp.com/)

When you're devloping on a computer you need to have a top-level domain that will never happen on the web, it's
reserved for local development. Two recommended and most common are .local and .test

Once you walk through the config settings, LOCAL will create the container for your project with the selected
configurations, additionally, it installs wordpress and spins everything out. It can take a little while.

Once finished, Local spins up the site and starts all the servers

Now that Local is installed, you can create as many sites as you want BUT it's important to remember that every time
a site is running live it runs it's own container and servers (so probably want to limit them running simultaneously)

If you want to make changes to the db you can click on database/adminer to open the browser based db

It is recommended anytime you create a new site to go to the SSL tab and enable the certificate by clicking trust...
After that, it's recommended to use https:// to view site

You can enable LiveLink so that you are able to share a temp. hosted server of your site for people to view
(typically for development purposes). Important to note that when you don't need it to turn it off so that people aren't
accessing a part of your unfinished development.

To create a Blueprint of a website - just right-click on the website design title you want to make the template from
and hit save.
