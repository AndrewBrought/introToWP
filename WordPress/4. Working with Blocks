We can use the i icon to see hierarchical headings and subheadings and we can select one to jump to that part
of the post

LINKS:
We can highlight any text and click the link icon - so select a location within the site you can start typing in
the search box and substring suggestions will start populating for you to direct your link to

You can also copy an external link, highlight text and hit paste - intuitively WordPress will create a hyperlink to
the desire url without altering the text.

To continue to write text outside of the link you need to hit the right arrow twice to tell WP that the text is no
longer meant to be part of the hyperlink
