WordPress is a web publishing application

We can use it to publish content onto the web.

WordPress works as an interface between:
    - You the content publisher
    - A database and server where all that content is stored
    - The visitor who accesses that content through their web browser.

We can create different types of content including:
    - posts
    - pages
    - media elements

Each content has their own unique properties which can be extended through plugins and themes, and each can have
comments associated with them

When a new post, page or media item is created, a new entry is made in the WordPress database (MySQL) containing all
the information associated with that item.
    - title
    - content
    - author
    - publishing date
    -relationships and so on

If media elements are uploaded like an image added to a post, the physical storage of an image along with its title,
alt text, and other properties are stored in the db - the relationships are created to say 'this' image was originally
uploaded to that post.

Once a post, page, or media item is published, the data is accessed through url, WordPress receives the data from the
db and populates the correct template for that type of content based on the chosen theme. The result is what
the user will perceive as your website.

$$$ In WordPress, when you publish content on the web, you're creating a database entry. When a visitor makes a
 url request that to that content, the APPLICATION BUILDS A VIEW containing all the info, on the fly - what they
 perceive as a webpage.  There is no page. Only the idea of a page realized when someone visits the url from a browser

    -This means you can edit the content of any item at anytime, change the appearance of one piece of content or your
    entire site - - without having to change the content itself.

** WordPress separates content and content management from it's presentation, and gives you absolute control over every
aspect.


WordPress, the application, runs on a server alongside a database. Where that the server is (lives) is up to you or
site administrator.
